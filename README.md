### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm Lucas Lima.

I'm a self-taught progammer, civil engineering student and a :earth_americas: brazilian young man. I love solve problems of my common life with programming. The IT world always got me with stars in my eyes and it's being very fun to learn web development and other computer science stuff.

- :dart: My goal is to become a fullstack programmer.
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on my Personal Linear Equation System Solver - PLESS 1.0. It is what actually made me want to learn to program at all.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript basics (objects and JSON structure, to be more exact).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an Open Source project when I got more practice and expertise with programming languages and IT in general.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for helping people's lives and jobs to get more simple and satisfactory with the help of programming.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about mathematics and engineering physics and I'll surely help you! xD
