### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
## I'm J.A. Lucas Lima.

I'm a self-taught progammer, civil engineering student and a :earth_americas: brazilian young man. I love to solve problems of my common life with programming. The IT world always got me with stars in my eyes and it's being so much fun to learn web development and other computer science stuff.

- :dart: My goal is to become a fullstack programmer.
- ðŸ”­ I'm currently working on case studies of a restaurant website and I'm rebuilding my Udemy projects with more advanced features that I have in my arsenal nowadays
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Javascript basics (objects and asynchronous JS).
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on an Open Source project when I got more practice and expertise with programming languages and IT in general.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking to help people's lives and work to be simpler and satisfying with the help of programming.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about mathematics and engineering physics and I will surely help you! xD
