### Hi there 👋
## I'm J.A. Lucas Lima.

I'm a self-taught progammer, student and a :earth_americas: brazilian young man. I love to solve problems of my common life with programming. The IT world always got me with stars in the eyes and it's being very fun to learn web development and other computer science stuff.

- 🎯 My goal is to become a responsible and solid-based programmer.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on an Open Source project when I got more practice and expertise with programming languages and IT in general.
- 🤔 I’m looking to help people's lives and work to be simpler and satisfying with the help of programming.
- 💬 Ask me about mathematics and engineering physics and I will surely help you! xD
- 📝 I'm currently learning about Algorithms and Data Structures (with Karumanchi's book). Besides, I've chosen and am focusing on .NET (C#).
